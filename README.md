# Instructions

After installing dependencies through npm i

create database for canoe_demo and run npm run seed to sync the database;

Run the the code with npm run start-dev to see the application.

# Things to note

Database integer numbers are muliplied to 100 to account for Javascript floating point accuracy in numbers, on the frontend the numbers are changed back by dividng 100

Some of the files are from boilerplate such as sockets etc. which weren't used

Spent alot of time on docker, was able to connect the server but still trying to get docker through with some advice from others as I am still new to this.
